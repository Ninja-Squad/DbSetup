# Overview

DbSetup allows populating a database before executing automated integration tests (typically, DAO/Repository automated tests). 
Although DBUnit, which is a great project, allows doing the same thing and much more, it's also harder to use and setup. 
And in our experience, in 98% of the cases, DBUnit is only used to pre-populate a database before executing every test method. 
This is the task on which DbSetup concentrates.

The philosophy of DbSetup is that DAO tests should not have to setup the database, execute tests, and then remove everything from the database. 
Instead, a single setup method should be used to delete everything from the database (whatever the previous test put in it, or the initial state 
of the database tables), and then populate it with the data necessary to execute the test.

Another design choice of DbSetup is to provide an easy to use and simple Java API to populate the database, rather than loading data from external 
XML files. Using a Java API has several advantages:

   - It allows using real Java types as data (longs, enums, etc.)
   - It allows defining default values, looping to generate several similar rows, storing data sets in variables or factorizing their 
     creation using resusable methods
   - It allows viewing the data sets easily, without having to open external files, by storing the data set directly into the test class, 
     or by navigating through classes and methods using the IDE shortcuts.
   - For more complex situations, like cyclic referential integrity constraints between rows, the Java API allows easily integrating SQL 
     statements into the sequence of operations to execute to pre-populate the database. These SQL statements can, for example, disable 
     constraints and re-enable them.

# How to...
## build

    gradlew build

## install the artifacts in your own local Maven repository
    
    gradlew publishToMavenLocal
    
## release a new version of DbSetup

 - Make sure you have a file named `gradle.properties` under `HOME/.gradle`, and this file contains the following 
properties:

        sonatypeUsername=<the sonatype user name>
        sonatypePassword=<the sonatype password>       
        signing.password=<the password used to protect your PGP key configured in the ninjasquad bintray account>
        bintray.key=<the api key of the ninjasquad bintray account>
        
 - Make sure the version of DbSetup in the project's `gradle.properties` file is the right one. It must not end with `-SNAPSHOT`
 - Execute
 
        gradlew clean build bintrayUpload
        
That should upload the artefacts to the ninjasquad's bintray maven repo, sign then with the keypair stored in bintray,
and sync it with jcenter and Maven central.

Note: the bintray plugin acts sometimes strangely (hangs, or 400 errors). It can be useful to disable the gradle daemon
by passing `-no-daemon`. Passing `--info` also helps understanding what's going on. 

Note: to check the jar file and pom publication before uploading, you can use 

    gradlew publish
    
which will simply publish under the `build/repo` directory of each project.
