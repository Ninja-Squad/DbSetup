# Overview

DbSetup allows populating a database before executing automated integration tests (typically, DAO/Repository automated tests). Although DBUnit, which is a great project, allows doing the same thing and much more, it's also harder to use and setup. And in our experience, in 98% of the cases, DBUnit is only used to pre-populate a database before executing every test method. This is the task on which DbSetup concentrates.

The philosophy of DbSetup is that DAO tests should not have to setup the database, execute tests, and then remove everything from the database. Instead, a single setup method should be used to delete everything from the database (whatever the previous test put in it, or the initial state of the database tables), and then populate it with the data necessary to execute the test.

Another design choice of DbSetup is to provide an easy to use and simple Java API to populate the database, rather than loading data from external XML files. Using a Java API has several advantages:

   - It allows using real Java types as data (longs, enums, etc.)
   - It allows defining default values, looping to generate several similar rows, storing data sets in variables or factorizing their creation using resusable methods
   - It allows viewing the data sets easily, without having to open external files, by storing the data set directly into the test class, or by navigating through classes and methods using the IDE shortcuts.
   - For more complex situations, like cyclic referential integrity constraints between rows, the Java API allows easily integrating SQL statements into the sequence of operations to execute to pre-populate the database. These SQL statements can, for example, disable constraints and re-enable them.

# How to...
## build

    gradlew build

## install the artifacts in your own local Maven repository
    
    gradlew install
    
## deploy a snapshot to the sonatype *snapshots* repository

 - Make sure you have a file named `gradle.properties` under `HOME/.gradle`, and this file contains the following 
properties:

        sonatypeUsername=<the sonatype user name>
        sonatypePassword=<the sonatype password>
    
 - Make sure the version on DbSetup, in the project's `gradle.properties` file, ends with `SNAPSHOT`
 - Execute
 
        gradlew uploadArchives
        
## release a new version of DbSetup

 - Make sure you have PGP installed, and have a key pair generated and published. If you don't, follow 
   [these instructions](https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/How+To+Generate+PGP+Signatures+With+Maven)
 - Make sure you have a file named `gradle.properties` under `HOME/.gradle`, and this file contains the following 
properties:

        sonatypeUsername=<the sonatype user name>
        sonatypePassword=<the sonatype password>
        
        signing.keyId=<the ID of your PGP key>
        signing.password=<the password used to protect your PGP key
        signing.secretKeyRingFile=<the absolute name of the secring.gpg file>
        
 - Make sure the version of DbSetup in the project's `gradle.properties` file is the right one. It must not end with `SNAPSHOT`
 - Execute
 
        gradlew uploadArchives
        
 - Follow [these instructions](https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-8a.ReleaseIt) 
   (section 8.a only)
