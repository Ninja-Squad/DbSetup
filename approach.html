                <h1>Why use DbSetup?</h1>
            </div>
            
            <h2><a name="xml-sucks-java-rules"></a>XML sucks. Java rules.</h2>
            <p>
                Most database testing tools use XML, YAML or SQL files to define test data sets. And those
                approaches have several drawbacks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Java developers are good at Java. Java IDEs are good at Java. Why use another language
                        if Java can do it?
                    <li>XML datasets have lots of repetitions. Each row of a table repeats the name of all the 
                        columns of the table.
                    <li>XML is not a programming language. You can't easily factor out some common parts or 
                        parameterize a data set. You can't use tests or loops.
                    <li>XML doesn't allow you to use constants or enums that are defined in your Java code.
                        It doesn't allow you to name a specific ID. It doesn't have any other type than string.
                    <li>XML files are hard to navigate. You can't have your data set defined in the test itself.
                        With DbSetup, data sets are in the test class itself, or one control-click away from the test
                        class.
                </ul>
                
                DbSetup lets you define data sets in Java, in a very intuitive and non-verbose way. Compare the following data
                sets:
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="span6">
                    <h3>XML syntax</h3>
                    <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;dataset&gt;
    &lt;PERSON ID="1" FIRST_NAME="John" LAST_NAME="Doe" 
            BIRTH_DATE="1975-05-06" VERSION="0"/&gt;
    &lt;PERSON ID="2" FIRST_NAME="Mark" LAST_NAME="Smith" 
            BIRTH_DATE="1980-07-03" VERSION="0"/&gt;
    &lt;PERSON ID="3" FIRST_NAME="Claire" LAST_NAME="Connell" 
            BIRTH_DATE="1981-09-17" VERSION="0"/&gt;
&lt;/dataset&gt;</pre>
                </div>
                <div class="span6">
                    <h3>DbSetup syntax</h3>
                    <pre class="prettyprint">
Insert.into("PERSON")
      .withDefaultValue("VERSION", 0)
      .columns("ID", "FIRST_NAME", "LAST_NAME", "BIRTH_DATE")
      .values(1, "John", "Doe", "1975-05-06")
      .values(2, "Mark", "Smith", "1980-07-03")
      .values(3, "Claire", "Connell", "1981-09-17")
      .build();</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h2><a name="you-are-in-control"></a>You're in control</h2>
            <p>
                DbSetup doesn't try to do everything for you and to guess which tables should be deleted based
                on what has been inserted, and in which order. You're not limited to deletes and inserts. If you have
                some cyclic dependencies in your data set, you can use an update statement, or even disable constraints,
                wherever you want during the setup, using a <code>SqlOperation</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Defining your own operations is easy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since everything is done and defined in Java, inserting a complex piece of data, or a large numer of
                rows, or a piece of binary data that can't be written easily in XML, is not a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reusing a common part of a setup, parameterize it, is as simple as defining and calling a Java method.
            </p>
            
            <h2><a id="dbsetup-is-fast"></a>DbSetup is fast</h2>
            <p>
                Most of the database operations in an application, especially when you use an ORM, are read-only operations.
                A typical repository contains many <code>find()</code> methods that you want to test, and very few <code>create()</code>
                or <code>save()</code>. Instead of re-populating the database before each test, even though the previous one
                used the same data set and was read-only,
                DbSetup allows populating the database only if it needs to be populated. By using a <code>DbSetupTracker</code>,
                and adding a single line of code in your read-only tests, you can avoid lots of unnecessary database repopulations,
                making your tests run much faster, and still leaving test methods independant.
            </p>
            <h2><a id="dbsetup-is-simple"></a>DbSetup is extremely simple</h2>
            <p>
                DbSetup contains very few classes, and typical usage involves a very small portion of these classes. You should be
                <a href="user-guide.html#getting-started">up and running</a> in a few minutes.
